    <h2>AMAGO_history</h2>
    <p>
        Baroque and classical eras
        In the Baroque era, the size and composition of an orchestra were not standardised. There were large differences
        in size, instrumentation and playing styles—and therefore in orchestral soundscapes and palettes — between the
        various European regions. The Baroque orchestra ranged from smaller orchestras (or ensembles) with one player
        per part, to larger-scale orchestras with many players per part. Examples of the smaller variety were Bach's
        orchestras, for example in Koethen, where he had access to an ensemble of up to 18 players. Examples of
        large-scale Baroque orchestras would include Corelli's orchestra in Rome which ranged between 35 and 80 players
        for day-to-day performances, being enlarged to 150 players for special occasions.[5]

        In the classical era, the orchestra became more standardized with a small to medium-sized string section and a
        core wind section consisting of pairs of oboes, flutes, bassoons and horns, sometimes supplemented by percussion
        and pairs of clarinets and trumpets.
